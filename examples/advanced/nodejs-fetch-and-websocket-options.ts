 *
 * Indeed, polluting the global scope is not a recommended practicte

 *
 * We will configure the `DfuseClient` instance when creating it via
 * the factory to pass the `fetch` and `WebSocket options directly.
 *
 * **Note** This example completely avoids importing `../config` to ensure
 *          we really do not pollute the global scope. Ensures you have the

         * `voters` table on EOS.

         * WebSocket API to see what is accepted as it's second argument.
